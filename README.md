# Point transformations and slicing

Here you will find our project implementation of Point transformations and slicing project. This project was part of our evaluation and project work in ELE510 BILDEBEHANDLING OG MASKINSYN.
This was a group project Dawit Habtemariam Kidane and Sondre Tenn√∏.

Github link: https://github.com/Sondreten/Point-transformations-and-slicing

## Task

Define and Explain different types of point transformations including some slicing (for example density-slicing orbit-plane slicing) operations. How can it be useful? Chose some methods and perform illustrative experiments.

## Code

All of our code in this project are in one single jupyter notebook file, 'Project21.ipynb'.
Going through each section as they were implemented, download libraries, loading images, pointwise transformations, slicings, results, conclusion.

## Environment

Your environment is expected to be an Anaconda base environment with Python version 3.6+.
Your environment is expected to be able to download and run the libraries used in the notebook.

## Paper

To contemplate the code, we have written a paper discussing the various methods and techniques used in this project. What approaches we have chosen and why we did certain things and the results we got.
The paper can be found in this github repository as ???.
